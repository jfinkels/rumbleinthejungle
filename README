The Squabble in Strobl...

The Wrangle in Spangle...

The Quarrel in Sorell...

rumbleinthejungle prints humorous rhyming phrases of the form "the dispute in
Beirut", as appears in the 2009 film *[The Slammin' Salmon][1]*, itself an
homage to the historic boxing match, [The Rumble in the Jungle][2].

## How it works ##

The algorithm is relatively simple.

- get synonyms for some simple "fight" words from a thesaurus
  (`data/th_en_US_v2.dat`) that appears to have come originally from
  [WordNet][w]
- get a list of cities from a trimmed version of a database from [MaxMind][m]
  (`data/cities.dat`)
- get the pronunciation of the words from the [CMU Pronunciation
  Dictionary][c], via the [NLTK][4] library.
- compare the last few sounds in the pronunciation of each "fight" word and
  each city to check if they rhyme
